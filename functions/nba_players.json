Nicknamed \"King James,\" he is considered to be one of the greatest basketball players in history and is often compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time. James is the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and ranks fourth in career assists. He has won four NBA championships over three teams with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, and Los Angeles Lakers. James has led his teams to ten NBA Finals. He has four MVP awards, four Finals MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. He has been named an All-Star nineteen times, selected to the All-NBA Team eighteen times, and to the All-Defensive Team six times.\r\n\r\nJames grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010 and leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat; this was announced in the television special The Decision and is among the most controversial free-agent decisions in sports history.\r\n\r\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse. In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP. James is also the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.\r\n\r\nOff the court, James has accumulated more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning two Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He has won 19 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). James has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza/community center, and medical center in Akron.","strNumber":"23","strHeight":"6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)","strWebsite":"","strYoutube":"","strDescriptionIL":null,"strRender":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/render/of2u2w1676059602.png","idAPIfootball":null,"strLocked":"unlocked","idTransferMkt":null,"strCreativeCommons":"Yes","dateDied":null,"intSoccerXMLTeamID":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strTeam":"Los Angeles Lakers","strTwitter":"twitter.com/kingjames","strSigning":"","strSide":"","strGender":"Male","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com/LeBron","strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strThumb":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/xqnfa51723398837.jpg","idTeam2":null,"dateSigned":null,"strPoster":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/poster/de4ati1759266667.jpg","strStatus":"Injured","strDescriptionPL":null},{"id":"34153743","strPlayerAlternate":"","idTeamNational":null,"strPlayer":"Chauncey Billups","strOutfitter":"","idESPN":null,"strSport":"Basketball","strWeight":"210 lb (95 kg)","strDescriptionCN":null,"strAgent":"","strBirthLocation":"Denver, Colorado","strPosition":"Manager","strCutout":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/pw20uv1683226470.png","strTeam2":"","idPlayerManager":null,"intLoved":"0","strEthnicity":"Black","strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strFanart1":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strFanart2":null,"strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCollege":null,"strKit":"","idPlayer":"34153743","strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strWage":"","strDescriptionES":"Chauncey Billups (Denver, Colorado, 25 de septiembre de 1976) es un exjugador estadounidense de baloncesto que disputó 16 temporadas en la NBA.\r\n\r\nSu mejor etapa como profesional la vivió en Detroit Pistons, donde jugó durante seis temporadas (2002-2008) y logró un anillo de campeón en 2004.

Howard was a collegiate All-American, had a 19-year NBA career with eight different teams (including All-Star and All-NBA nods and two NBA championships), and served as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team.\r\n\r\nHoward was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, where he was a high school All-American center and an honors student at Chicago Vocational Career Academy. He gained national prominence after signing with the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team as part of its Fab Five recruiting class of 1991 (including fellow future NBA stars Jalen Rose and Chris Webber), and reached the finals of the NCAA tournament in both 1992 and 1993. Although many of the Fab Five's accomplishments of the 1990s were vacated due to NCAA rules violations, Howard was not personally implicated in the scandal and his individual accomplishments, including as a 1993–94 NCAA All-American, continue to be recognized.\r\n\r\nHe began his NBA career as the fifth overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft, selected by the Washington Bullets, and played in Washington for the first seven seasons of a 19-season journeyman career. His longest stints after Washington were three seasons each with the Houston Rockets (2004–2007) and the Miami Heat (2010–2013). Howard was a one-time All-Star and one-time All-NBA power forward. He made three NBA Finals appearances and won two NBA titles, all with the Heatles-era Miami Heat, while serving as a veteran role player in his final three NBA seasons.\r\n\r\nAfter retiring as a player in 2013, he remained with the Heat organization as an assistant coach for the next six seasons, before accepting the head coaching position at his alma mater, Michigan, in 2019. Howard earned numerous awards for his performance as a coach in the 2020–21 season, including AP National Coach of the Year and Big Ten Coach of the Year. Howard also became the first coach to earn a No.1 seed as both a player and coach, after the Wolverines secured a No. 1 seed in the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Howard coached his son, Jett Howard, at Michigan during the 2022-23 season.\r\n\r\nHoward was fired by Michigan in 2024, and later joined the assistant coaching staff of the Brooklyn Nets.","strNumber":"","strHeight":"6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)","strWebsite":"","strYoutube":"","strDescriptionIL":null,"strRender":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/render/pct0ux1759592454.png","idAPIfootball":null,"strLocked":"unlocked","idTransferMkt":null,"strCreativeCommons":"No","dateDied":null,"intSoccerXMLTeamID":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strTeam":"Brooklyn Nets","strTwitter":"","strSigning":"","strSide":"","strGender":"Male","strFacebook":"","strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strThumb":"https://www.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/i3dzu41759592109.jpg","idTeam2":null,"dateSigned":null,"strPoster":null,"strStatus":"Coaching","strDescriptionPL":null},{"id":"34153913","strPlayerAlternate":"","idTeamNational":null,"strPlayer":"Greg Buckner","strOutfitter":"","idESPN":null,"strSport":"Basketball","strWeight":"210 lb (95 kg)","strDescriptionCN":null,"strAgent":"","strBirthLocation":"Hopkinsville, Kentucky, U.S.","strPosition":"Assistant Coach","strCutout":null,"strTeam2":"","idPlayerManager":null,"intLoved":"0","strEthnicity":"Black","strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strFanart1":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strFanart2":null,"strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCollege":null,"strKit":"","idPlayer":"34153913","strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strWage":"","strDescriptionES":null,"dateBorn":"1976-09-16","strLastName":"Buckner","strNationality":"United States","idWikidata":"Q1609283","strBanner":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strInstagram":"","idTeam":"134874","strDescriptionEN":"Gregory Derayle Buckner (born September 16, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player who is an assistant coach for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

He played one year of college basketball for the California Golden Bears, being named first-team all-conference and Freshman of the Year in the Pac-12 Conference.\r\n\r\nDeclaring for the 2016 NBA draft after his freshman season, Brown was selected by the Celtics with the third overall pick. As a professional, he has split his time between shooting guard and small forward. Brown is a two-time NBA All-Star, and he helped the Celtics reach the 2022 NBA Finals.\r\n\r\nBrown is primarily a vegetarian and has diverse interests including learning Spanish, studying history, meditation, and philosophy. He is also a big soccer fan as well as a big fan of anime. Many have described him as an unusual athlete, with many ambitions beyond basketball. Brown, who is African-American, assembled a primarily African-American advisory team prior to the NBA draft, but did not hire an agent. He was criticized by some as \"too smart\" to play in the NBA, with some scouts worrying he would grow tired of playing basketball and instead opt to pursue other career paths. This criticism was taken by some as racial bias against African-Americans.\r\n\r\nWhen he was 22 years old, Brown became the National Basketball Players Association's youngest elected vice president. In recent years, he has spoken on the importance of education and technology at Harvard University, the University of California, Berkeley, and MIT. In 2019, Brown was named as a MIT Media Lab fellow and has since collaborated with the university to create the Bridge Program, which mentors Greater Boston youth and high school students of color, who are interested in pursuing careers in STEM programs. Through his work with MIT and his 7uice Foundation, Brown has taken a strong interest in tackling education and income inequality, among other social advocacy initiatives.\r\n\r\nBrown's father is Marselles Brown, a professional boxer, who is the 2016 WBU World Champion, the 2015 WBU C.A.M. Heavyweight Champion, and a member of the Hawaii State Boxing Commission Board.\r\n\r\nBrown has a YouTube channel, where he has posted several documentary-style video series depicting his life during the season and off-season workouts. The first episode, FCHWPO: Pawn to E4, was posted on January 31, 2017. The video title refers to Brown's love of chess. FCHWPO, which is also Brown's Twitter and Instagram handle, stands for Faith, Consistency, Hard Work Pays Off.\r\n\r\nBrown is the cousin of professional football cornerback A. J.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest scorers and shooting guards in NBA history. In 2021, Harden was honored as one of the league's top 75 players by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.\r\n\r\nHarden played college basketball for the Arizona State Sun Devils, where he was named a consensus All-American and Pac-10 Player of the Year in 2009. Harden was selected with the third overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder. In 2012, he was named NBA Sixth Man of the Year and helped Oklahoma City reach the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Miami Heat in five games. After the Thunder refused to offer him a max contract extension, Harden was unwilling to take a pay cut and was subsequently traded to the Houston Rockets before the 2012–13 season.\r\n\r\nIn his first season with the Rockets, Harden set or matched several team records and was named to his first All-NBA Team (a third-team selection), as well as his first NBA All-Star team. Over the next seven and a half seasons with Houston, Harden led the league in scoring three times and assists once, and was named the NBA Most Valuable Player in 2018. He was also named to eight consecutive NBA All-Star teams and earned All-NBA Team honors seven times, including six first-team selections.\r\n\r\nAfter requesting a trade at the beginning of the 2020–21 season, Harden was traded to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a four-team trade.

Durant has won two NBA championships, four Olympic gold medals, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He has been named to 11 All-NBA teams (including six First Teams) and selected 15 times as an NBA All-Star. In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. He ranks eighth among NBA career scoring leaders.\r\n\r\nDurant was heavily recruited in high school, widely regarded as the second-best player his senior year. He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, during which he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. Durant was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise (which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008), leading them to a Finals appearance in 2012 and winning the MVP award for the 2013–2014 season. He later signed with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, who won a record 73 regular season games the previous year. Durant won consecutive NBA championships and Finals MVPs in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 NBA Finals, he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Phoenix Suns the following year. After two full seasons with Phoenix, Durant was traded to the Houston Rockets in July 2025.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the U.S. national team, Durant has won four gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, 2020 and 2024), and is the leading scorer in Team USA's Olympic basketball history. In 2024, he became the first male athlete to win four Olympics gold medals in a team sport. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship. Durant is the only player in basketball history with MVPs in the NBA, Olympics and World Cup.\r\n\r\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In 2018, Durant was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world. In recent years, he has contributed to The Players' Tribune as both a photographer and writer.","strNumber":"35","strHeight":"6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)","strWebsite":"","strYoutube":"","strDescriptionIL":null,"strRender":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/render/9ftg8s1698837842.png","idAPIfootball":null,"strLocked":"unlocked","idTransferMkt":null,"strCreativeCommons":"No","dateDied":null,"intSoccerXMLTeamID":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strTeam":"Houston Rockets","strTwitter":"","strSigning":"","strSide":"","strGender":"Male","strFacebook":"","strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strThumb":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/izpsjb1698837776.jpg","idTeam2":null,"dateSigned":null,"strPoster":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/poster/bb6lo41749032150.jpg","strStatus":"Active","strDescriptionPL":null},{"id":"34161169","strPlayerAlternate":"","idTeamNational":null,"strPlayer":"Klay Thompson","strOutfitter":"","idESPN":null,"strSport":"Basketball","strWeight":"215 lb (98 kg)","strDescriptionCN":null,"strAgent":"","strBirthLocation":"Los Angeles, California","strPosition":"Shooting Guard","strCutout":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/f4msb21728628214.png","strTeam2":"","idPlayerManager":null,"intLoved":"0","strEthnicity":"White","strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strFanart1":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strFanart2":null,"strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCollege":null,"strKit":"","idPlayer":"34161169","strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strWage":"","strDescriptionES":null,"dateBorn":"1990-02-08","strLastName":"Thompson","strNationality":"United States","idWikidata":"Q29342","strBanner":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strInstagram":"","idTeam":"134875","strDescriptionEN":"Klay Alexander Thompson (born February 8, 1990) is an American professional basketball player for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

After high school, he attended DePauw University, where he played basketball and earned a degree in economics. Stevens made the all-conference team multiple times and was a three-time Academic All-America nominee. He transitioned into coaching after quitting his job at Eli Lilly and Company, joining the basketball program at Butler University as a volunteer prior to the 2000–01 season. Stevens was promoted to a full-time assistant coach the following season. After five seasons in the role, he assumed the position of head coach on April 4, 2007, after Todd Lickliter left to coach the Iowa Hawkeyes. In his first year, Stevens led Butler to 30 wins, becoming the third-youngest head coach in NCAA Division I history to have a 30-win season.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, his third year as head coach, Stevens broke the NCAA record for most wins in a coach's first three years, exceeding the previous record by eight wins. In the NCAA tournament, Stevens coached Butler to the first Final Four in school history, while also becoming the second-youngest head coach to make an NCAA national championship game, losing 61–59 to Duke. With the following season's team also making the Final Four, Stevens became the youngest coach to go to two Final Fours. Stevens coached the Bulldogs in their second consecutive national championship game on April 4, 2011, where the team again lost, this time to the Connecticut Huskies. Stevens was regularly named a finalist for Horizon League Coach of the Year award, winning twice, and was also a nominee for both the Hugh Durham Award and Jim Phelan Award in every year of his college career.\r\n\r\nThis success garnered Stevens the head coaching job with the Boston Celtics in 2013, when he signed a six-year, $22 million contract. After undertaking a rebuild early in his tenure, Stevens led the Celtics to the NBA playoffs every year from 2014 to 2021, won a division championship in 2016–17, and appeared in the Eastern Conference finals in 2017, 2018, and 2020. He gained a reputation as one of the NBA's best coaches, with his motion offense and stingy defense earning plaudits from fans, peers, and players.\r\n\r\nIn June 2021, Stevens was named as the president of basketball operations and the de facto general manager of the Celtics following the resignation and retirement of Danny Ainge, before Ainge was talked out of retirement to join the Utah Jazz as their alternate governor later that year. In April 2024, Stevens was named the 2023–24 NBA Executive of the Year. Following that, he won his first NBA championship while with the Celtics as an executive, completing the rebuild that Stevens helped begin and oversee as the head coach.","strNumber":"","strHeight":"6 ft 1 in (1.85 m)","strWebsite":"","strYoutube":"","strDescriptionIL":null,"strRender":null,"idAPIfootball":null,"strLocked":"unlocked","idTransferMkt":null,"strCreativeCommons":"No","dateDied":null,"intSoccerXMLTeamID":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strTeam":"Boston Celtics","strTwitter":"","strSigning":"","strSide":"","strGender":"Male","strFacebook":"","strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strThumb":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/42doui1549823098.jpg","idTeam2":null,"dateSigned":null,"strPoster":null,"strStatus":"Coaching","strDescriptionPL":null,"strLastName":"Stevens"},{"id":"34165682","strPlayerAlternate":"","idTeamNational":null,"strPlayer":"Kenny Atkinson","strOutfitter":"","idESPN":null,"strSport":"Basketball","strWeight":"180 lb (82 kg)","strDescriptionCN":null,"strAgent":"","strBirthLocation":"Northport, New York","strPosition":"Manager","strCutout":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/vbfm2k1731965544.png","strTeam2":"","idPlayerManager":null,"intLoved":"0","strEthnicity":"White","strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strFanart1":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strFanart2":null,"strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCollege":null,"strKit":"","idPlayer":"34165682","strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strWage":"","strDescriptionES":null,"dateBorn":"1967-06-02","strLastName":"Atkinson","strNationality":"United States","idWikidata":null,"strBanner":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strInstagram":"","idTeam":"134871","strDescriptionEN":"Kenneth Neil Atkinson (born June 2, 1967) is an Spanish American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

He previously spent 19 seasons at the University of Florida, where his Florida Gators teams won back-to-back NCAA championships in 2006 and 2007. Donovan has more wins than any other coach in the history of the Florida basketball program, and he coached the Gators to more NCAA tournament appearances, NCAA tournament wins, and Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships than all other Florida coaches combined.\r\n\r\nDonovan was born and raised in Rockville Centre on Long Island, New York. As the starting point guard for Rick Pitino's Providence team, Donovan led the Friars to the 1987 Final Four. As such, he is one of only four men (Dean Smith, Joe B. Hall and Bobby Knight being the others) to appear in the NCAA Final Four as a player and win the NCAA national championship as a coach.\r\n\r\nBefore his tenure at Florida, Donovan spent most of the 1987–88 season as a reserve guard for the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks, who at the time were coached by his college coach, Rick Pitino. After leaving the NBA and briefly working as a Wall Street stock broker, Donovan followed Pitino to the University of Kentucky, where he served as an assistant coach for the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball from 1989 to 1993. He accepted his first head coaching position at Marshall University in 1994 and led the Thundering Herd to a 35–20 record over two seasons.\r\n\r\nDonovan was hired to revive Florida's basketball program in 1996. After two losing seasons while he rebuilt the roster through relentless recruiting, Donovan's Gators began a streak of sixteen straight 20-win seasons, a period which included multiple conference championships, four Final Four appearances, two NCAA championships, and three SEC coach of the year awards.\r\n\r\nDuring Donovan's tenure at Florida, he was often rumored to be a candidate for various NCAA and NBA head coaching positions. In June 2007, after leading the Gators to their second consecutive national title, he accepted an offer to become the head coach of the NBA's Orlando Magic. However, he immediately had second thoughts, and after a week, he persuaded the Magic to release him from his newly signed contract and allow him to return to Florida, where he remained for eight more seasons.\r\n\r\nIn April 2015, Donovan agreed to become the head coach of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder.","strNumber":"","strHeight":"5 ft 11 in (1.80 m)","strWebsite":"","strYoutube":"","strDescriptionIL":null,"strRender":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/render/jt3dtk1683132554.png","idAPIfootball":null,"strLocked":"unlocked","idTransferMkt":null,"strCreativeCommons":"No","dateDied":null,"intSoccerXMLTeamID":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strTeam":"Chicago Bulls","strTwitter":"","strSigning":"","strSide":"","strGender":"Male","strFacebook":"","strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strThumb":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/y3nygo1550151793.jpg","idTeam2":null,"dateSigned":null,"strPoster":null,"strStatus":"Coaching","strDescriptionPL":null,"strLastName":"Donovan"},{"id":"34165779","strPlayerAlternate":"Mohamed Bamba","idTeamNational":null,"strPlayer":"Mo Bamba","strOutfitter":"","idESPN":null,"strSport":"Basketball","strWeight":"231 lb (105 kg)","strDescriptionCN":null,"strAgent":"","strBirthLocation":"Harlem, New York","strPosition":"Center","strCutout":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/pd2dwz1702319580.png","strTeam2":"","idPlayerManager":null,"intLoved":"0","strEthnicity":"Black","strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strFanart1":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strFanart2":null,"strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCollege":null,"strKit":"","idPlayer":"34165779","strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strWage":"","strDescriptionES":null,"dateBorn":"1998-05-12","strLastName":"Bamba","strNationality":"United States","idWikidata":null,"strBanner":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strInstagram":"","idTeam":"134878","strDescriptionEN":"Mohamed Fakaba Bamba (born May 12, 1998) is an American-Ivorian professional basketball player for the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Simmons was selected with the first overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. After sitting out a year due to an injured right foot, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2018 and was selected three times to the NBA All-Star Game. As the result of a holdout from the 76ers following the 2020–21 season, which led him to be traded to the Brooklyn Nets, Simmons is the most-fined player in NBA history, in terms of total financial loss.\r\n\r\nSimmons attended Box Hill Senior Secondary College in his hometown of Melbourne, Victoria, before moving to the United States to attend Montverde Academy in Montverde, Florida. In his only season in college, LSU began the season with high expectations, but they failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament. Simmons left school to enter the NBA draft, becoming the third Melbourne-born number one overall pick in 11 years, alongside Andrew Bogut and Kyrie Irving. Simmons is the son of an American-born father, Dave, who played professional basketball in Australia. A dual citizen of Australia and the United States, Simmons has played for the Australian national team.","strNumber":"25","strHeight":"6 ft 11 in (2.11 m)","strWebsite":"","strYoutube":"","strDescriptionIL":null,"strRender":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/render/qvqd901739532057.png","idAPIfootball":null,"strLocked":"unlocked","idTransferMkt":null,"strCreativeCommons":"No","dateDied":null,"intSoccerXMLTeamID":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strTeam":"Los Angeles Clippers","strTwitter":"","strSigning":"","strSide":"","strGender":"Male","strFacebook":"","strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strThumb":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/jjwu6t1739532118.jpg","idTeam2":null,"dateSigned":null,"strPoster":null,"strStatus":"Active","strDescriptionPL":null},{"id":"34165825","strPlayerAlternate":"","idTeamNational":null,"strPlayer":"Deandre Ayton","strOutfitter":"","idESPN":null,"strSport":"Basketball","strWeight":"250 lb (113 kg)","strDescriptionCN":null,"strAgent":"","strBirthLocation":"Nassau, Bahamas","strPosition":"Center","strCutout":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/mn3o8f1709725217.png","strTeam2":"Bahamas Basketball","idPlayerManager":null,"intLoved":"0","strEthnicity":"Black","strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strFanart1":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strFanart2":null,"strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCollege":null,"strKit":"","idPlayer":"34165825","strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strWage":"$8.10m","strDescriptionES":null,"dateBorn":"1998-07-23","strLastName":"Ayton","strNationality":"Bahamas","idWikidata":"Q22958459","strBanner":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strInstagram":"","idTeam":"134867","strDescriptionEN":"Deandre Edoneille Ayton Sr. (/diˈɑːndreɪ ˈeɪtən/ dee-AHN-dray AY-tən; born July 23, 1998) is a Bahamian professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

A five-star recruit as early as his sophomore year of high school, Maxey contemplated leaving high school early to play for the Kentucky Wildcats, but ultimately stayed at South Garland, where he was a McDonald's All-American and Texas Mr. Basketball during his senior year. He then played for the Wildcats, where he would set a school record of 26 points in his collegiate debut.\r\n\r\nAfter Maxey's freshman season at Kentucky was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, he elected to enter the 2020 NBA draft, where the 76ers selected him 21st overall with their first-round pick. Maxey received limited playing time during his rookie season, making his first NBA start in a game where the 76ers could only field the league's minimum number of players. However, Ben Simmons's refusal to play for the 76ers the following season gave Maxey an opportunity to become the team's starting point guard.","strNumber":"","strHeight":"6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)","strWebsite":"","strYoutube":"","strDescriptionIL":null,"strRender":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/render/spba9d1700855307.png","idAPIfootball":null,"strLocked":"unlocked","idTransferMkt":null,"strCreativeCommons":"No","dateDied":null,"intSoccerXMLTeamID":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strTeam":"Philadelphia 76ers","strTwitter":"","strSigning":"","strSide":"","strGender":"Male","strFacebook":"","strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strThumb":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/0yeuz91700855261.jpg","idTeam2":null,"dateSigned":null,"strPoster":null,"strStatus":"Active","strDescriptionPL":null},{"id":"34196107","strPlayerAlternate":"","idTeamNational":null,"strPlayer":"Isaiah Joe","strOutfitter":"","idESPN":null,"strSport":"Basketball","strWeight":"165 lb (75 kg)","strDescriptionCN":null,"strAgent":"","strBirthLocation":"Fort Smith, Arkansas, U.S.","strPosition":"Shooting Guard","strCutout":"https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/t62bbq1709409626.png","strTeam2":"","idPlayerManager":null,"intLoved":"0","strEthnicity":"Black","strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strFanart1":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strFanart2":null,"strFanart3":null,"strFanart4":null,"strCollege":null,"strKit":"","idPlayer":"34196107","strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strWage":"","strDescriptionES":null,"dateBorn":"1999-07-02","strLastName":"Joe","strNationality":"United States","idWikidata":"Q74839687","strBanner":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strInstagram":"","idTeam":"134887","strDescriptionEN":"Derrick Isaiah Joe (born July 2, 1999) is an American professional basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

He also served as the head coach of the Nigerian national team from 2020 until 2022, coaching the team at the 2020 Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nBrown began coaching the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2005. The team reached the 2007 NBA Finals, where they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs. Brown was honored as NBA Coach of the Year for leading the Cavaliers to a team-record and league-best 66 wins in 2009. The Cavaliers won 61 games, again a league-best, in 2010. However, after the Cavaliers lost to the Boston Celtics in the 2010 Eastern Conference semifinals, Brown was fired. Brown succeeded Phil Jackson as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers in 2011 before being dismissed five games into the 2012–13 season. He returned to the Cavaliers in 2013, but was fired after one season. Brown then joined the Golden State Warriors as associate head coach in 2016; the team went on to defeat the Cavaliers in the 2017 and 2018 NBA Finals, and the Boston Celtics in the 2022 NBA Finals.\r\n\r\nHe departed from the Warriors in 2022 to become the head coach of the Sacramento Kings.

He has won five NBA championships as a head coach, four with the Los Angeles Lakers during their Showtime era in the 1980s and one with the Heat in 2006. Riley is a nine-time NBA champion across his tenures as a player (1972), assistant coach (1980), head coach (1982, 1985, 1987, 1988, 2006), and executive (2012, 2013). He is the first North American sports figure to win a championship as a player, as an assistant coach, as a head coach, and as an executive. Since the start of his NBA career through 2023, Riley has reached 19 NBA finals across six different decades, making 25 percent of all NBA Finals as a player, coach, or executive.\r\n\r\nRiley was named NBA Coach of the Year three times (1989–90, 1992–93 and 1996–97, as head coach of the Lakers, New York Knicks and Heat, respectively). He was head coach of an NBA All-Star Game team nine times: eight times with the Western Conference team (1982, 1983, 1985–1990, all as head coach of the Lakers) and once with the Eastern team (1993, as head coach of the Knicks). In 1996, he was named one of the 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history. In 2008, Riley was inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach.

She previously served as an Assistant Coach and Director of Coaching Analytics for the Detroit Pistons during the 2022–23 season, and as an Assistant Coach for the Toronto Raptors from 2019 to 2021. Donaldson was the first female coaching hire in franchise history for all three organizations.\r\n\r\nDonaldson played college basketball for the Northern Iowa Panthers and graduated in 2015 with a degree in Statistics and Actuarial Sciences. Though she aspired to play professionally after college, a series of several knee operations left her sidelined for much of her time as an athlete and ultimately ended her playing career. Following that setback, she pivoted to data analytics as a way to merge her passion for sports with her academic foundation in statistics. She began working at STATS LLC as a SportVU Data Analyst, working extensively with basketball player tracking data. In 2017, she joined the Toronto Raptors’ front office as a Data Analyst.\r\n\r\nAfter the Raptors won the 2019 NBA Finals, team president Masai Ujiri promoted Donaldson to the coaching staff, making her the 10th active female assistant coach in the NBA. At age 26, she was also the youngest active assistant coach in the league at the time.\r\n\r\nDuring the shortened 2020–21 NBA G League season, Donaldson joined the Raptors 905 as a front-of-the-bench Assistant Coach, helping guide the team to a league-best 12–3 record and a semifinal appearance.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, Donaldson co-founded Strata Athletics, a player development startup focused on delivering data-informed, learning-based training to youth athletes. During the summer of 2022, she joined the Hamilton Honey Badgers of the Canadian Elite Basketball League as an Assistant Coach and Director of Coaching Development and helped guide the team to its first championship.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward, Donaldson returned to the NBA with the Detroit Pistons as an Assistant Coach and Director of Coaching Analytics.

He started his professional life as a tax attorney with the Internal Revenue Service. He has been the owner of the White Sox and Bulls for nearly 40 years. As of May 2024, his net worth was estimated at US$2.2 billion.\r\n\r\nHe made his initial fortune in real estate, taking advantage of the Frank Lyon Co. v. United States decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed economic owners of realty to sell property and lease it back, while transferring the tax deduction for depreciation to the title owner.\r\n\r\nAs the owner and chairman of the Chicago Bulls since 1985, he oversaw a turnaround in the franchise's fortunes, culminating in six NBA Championships in the 1990s (1991–1993 and 1996–1998). He is controversial for his involvement (along with Jerry Krause) in breaking up the championship team by not hiring back Phil Jackson. He signed Michael Jordan as a baseball player during his sabbatical from basketball. He also moved the Bulls from Chicago Stadium to the United Center.\r\n\r\nAfter Reinsdorf's purchase of the White Sox in 1981, the franchise made the playoffs in 1983 for the first time since 1959, and won the World Series for the first time since 1917 in 2005, the only year during his tenure as owner in which the White Sox have won a playoff series. Reinsdorf moved the White Sox from Comiskey Park to New Comiskey Park in 1991 (now known as Rate Field). In both sporting endeavors, he has developed a reputation as an anti-labor union hardliner. Since the early 1990s, he has been considered one of the most influential basketball owners. He has been influential in instituting the salary cap and revenue sharing.
